  <h1>I build and break security systems until they actually reduce risk.</h1>

  <p>
    I'm Mert Satilmaz, a security engineer with a software engineering background. Before security, I spent six years building
    low-latency trading systems and market-making engines in C++ and Scala. That background shapes everything I do now:
    I write the tooling, build the automation, and engineer the systems that make security programs work at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most security failures aren't caused by a lack of tools.
    They're caused by poor engineering, noisy data, and false confidence.
    My work is about removing those failure modes.
  </p>

    <li>Why most vulnerability management programs fail at scale</li>
    <li>Building security automation with real code, not just configuration</li>
    <li>Cloud security as code that survives contact with real systems</li>
    <li>The intersection of software engineering and security engineering</li>
    <li>Embedding security into SDLCs without slowing teams down</li>
    <li>Incident response lessons you only learn after production incidents</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why You Might Care</h2>
