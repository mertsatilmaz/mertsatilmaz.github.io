# mert.satilmaz.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal site and writing on security engineering.

The focus is practical security at scale: vulnerability management, cloud security automation, incident response, and the failure modes that appear once systems grow beyond what tooling alone can handle.

The site is intentionally simple. The ideas are not.

## Live Site

https://mertsatilmaz.github.io

## Writing

Posts live under `/posts` and are published as static HTML.

Current topics include:
- Why vulnerability management fails at scale
- Turning scanner output into actionable remediation
- Cloud security automation beyond audit checklists
- Security engineering vs compliance theatre
- Incident response lessons from real systems

Writing is opinionated, experience-driven, and grounded in production environments.

## Security

## Scope and Intent

This repository is not a product, framework, or vendor blog.

It exists to document:
- how security systems fail in practice
- what actually scales
- and where commonly accepted approaches break down

If the ideas here are useful, reuse them. If you disagree, challenge them.

That is the point.
